Utility convention is to take `-utility(o)`, and `utility_min` is therefore the highest possible weight/maximum probability outcome. This mechanism does not scale based on the sensitivity of the utility function. For a utility function with sensitivity `alpha`, the mechanism is `2*alpha*eta` base-2 DP, and `2*alpha*ln(2)*eta` base-e DP.   The caller must ensure that `utility_min`, `utility_max`, `max_outcomes` and `outcomes` are determined independently of the `utility` function and any private data."]],"struct":[["ExponentialOptions","The exponential mechanism optional parameters.
